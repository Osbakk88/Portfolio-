              <h2>My Journey</h2>
              <p>
                I am Christina Anett Osbakk, a front-end developer student at
                Noroff. I started my journey in January 2024, and this is my
                first portfolio. I am excited to learn more about web
                development and design, constantly exploring new technologies
                and best practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a
                particular interest in creating responsive, accessible, and
                user-friendly websites. I am looking forward to creating more
                projects and improving my skills as I progress through my
                studies.

              <h2>AI & Development</h2>
              <p>
                One of my passions is exploring how AI can enhance the
                development process. I'm fascinated by AI-assisted coding tools
                and how they can help developers write better code, solve
                problems more efficiently, and learn new concepts faster.
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe that combining human creativity with AI capabilities
                opens up exciting possibilities for building innovative web
                solutions.

              <h2>Beyond Coding</h2>
              <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy reading books, watching movies, and
                spending time with my family and friends. I also love to travel
                and explore new places, which gives me fresh perspectives and
                inspiration for my work.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am passionate about technology and how it can be used to
                improve our lives. I am always looking for new challenges and
                opportunities to learn and grow, both personally and
                professionally.
